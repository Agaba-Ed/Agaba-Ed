## Hi there!

I'm Ed, a software engineering graduate. My journey began way back in 2007, fueled by a desire to create and explore. In 2013, when I finally got my hands on a phone with internet access, a whole new world opened up. Instructables became my go-to for DIY projects, and that's where I sparked an interest in electronics – resistors, transistors, the whole shebang!That's how I got hooked on coding.

Over the years, I've learned a lot of different things just to get something done or for fun. Whether it's tech-related, mastering a competitive chess game, or diving deep into the world of crypto, I'm always up for a challenge. I love getting lost in research papers, tackling complex projects, and solving coding problems. Lately, I've been drawn to  hackathons, and I'm eager to put my skills to the test!

### Let's Connect!

I'm always looking to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts, collaborate on projects, and keep learning. Feel free to reach out if you share my passion for building and exploring!
